### Reflection
  - This was a paired project assigned in Module 2 of the Front End Engineering program at Turing School of Software & Design.
  - This was our first introduction to writing in React, and working with data received from an API.
  - In addition to learning how to write stateful and presentational components, we also worked extensively with Enzyme and Jest testing libraries to hone our testing abilities in React.
